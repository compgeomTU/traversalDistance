# TraversalDistance
The traversal distance is a generalization of Fr√©chet distance for the graph vs graph case. More formally, given two embedded, connected graphs $H = (V_H ,E_H)$ and $G = (V_G,E_G)$ with straight edges, identifying $H$ and $G$ with the points lying on their edges we will call a mapping $f : [0,1] \rightarrow H $ which is continuous and surjective, a traversal of $H$ . A continuous (but not necessarily surjective) mapping $g : [0,1] \rightarrow G$ will be called a partial traversal of $G$. The traversal distance from $H$ to $G$ is defined as $$ \delta_T(H, G)=\inf _{f, g} \max _{t \in[0,1]}\|f(t)-g(t)\|, $$
where $f$ ranges over all traversals of $H$ and $g$ over all partial traversals of $G$.
